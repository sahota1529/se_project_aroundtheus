# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is Project 3 in which I was introduced to Figma. For this project, I have to make a responsive website and it was my first time making it. Definitely, it was challenging but finally I did it! This was such an achievement for me.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

**Plans for improving the project**

I will definitely practice more since this is what I'll be doing in the future, so I'll make sure I'm really good at making responisve websites. I think it came out great and I wouldn't improve just yet, but definitely soon I'll play around to see what else could be done.
